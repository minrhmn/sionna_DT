# Sionna_DT Notebooks

This repository organizes the notebooks by topic for easier discovery and to reduce overlap.

## Folder layout

- `sionna_experiments/`: Primary Sionna experiment notebooks (main focus).
- `channel_models/`: Channel model simulations (3GPP, CDL, TDL, RMa, path loss).
- `modulation_coding/`: Modulation and coding focused notebooks.
- `signal_processing/`: AWGN, synchronization, and PER/SNR analysis.
- `measurements/`: Measurement processing and OFDM response analysis.

## Notes

- Homework notebooks and duplicate variants were removed to reduce redundancy.
